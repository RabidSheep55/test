      "statement": "A gas-filled pneumatic strut in an automobile suspension system behaves like a piston-cylinder apparatus. At one instant when the piston is L = 0.15 m away from the closed end of the cylinder, the gas density is uniform at ρ = 18 kg/m3 and the piston begins to move away from the closed end at U = 12 m/s. The gas velocity is one-dimensional and proportional to distance from the closed end; it varies linearly from zero at the end to u = U at the piston. The density field at any instant in time is uniform in space.",
